                What is AI?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that 
                can think like humans. It can do things that are considered "smart.
                "AI technology can process large amounts of data in ways, unlike humans. 
                The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as recognize patterns, make decisions,
                and judge like humans.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: aqua;">Who is the founder of AI?</h2>
            <p>

            <h2 style="color: aqua;">To build your AI system, there are certain steps to follow:</h2>
            <P>
                1.Define a Goal. Before writing your first line of code, you
                have to define what problem you want to tackle.
            </P>
            <p>
                2.Gather and Clean the Data.
            </p>
            <P>

            <h2 style="color: aqua;">The basic model of AI Jarvis:</h2>
            <p>
                This project we developed and built is a basic model of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
                This AI model we developed and created is inspired by Iron Man movies in which he calls 
                or gives commands to his AI Assistant Jarvis, and Jarvis recognizes his voice and works with him. 
                So, this is a simple and basic model of Jarvis. The Jarvis we created works on the basis of speech 
                recognition, which gets the voice command and works on that. e.g., open YouTube, find your number 
                address,etc. So this model can be further developed to the next level. I am Rohith, and Yuvan we both 
                created and developed this and named it as the basic model of AI Jarvis.
